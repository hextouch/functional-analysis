# Functional Analysis

This repository provides a comprehensive foundation in functional analysis, focusing on concepts essential for machine learning, optimization, and advanced mathematical analysis.

## Topics Covered

- **Normed Spaces**: $L^p$ spaces, norms, convergence
- **Hilbert Spaces**: Inner products, projections, RKHS, Fourier analysis
- **Banach Spaces**: Completeness, convergence, fixed-point theorems
- **Operators**: Linear, bounded/unbounded, convolution, differential
- **Spectral Theory**: Eigenvalues/eigenvectors in infinite dimensions
- **Applications**: ML, optimization, signal processing, PDEs

## Structure

Each subdirectory contains a README and Python scripts illustrating key concepts and algorithms. Example code uses `numpy`, `scipy`, and other scientific libraries.

## Getting Started

To run the example scripts, ensure you have Python 3 and the required packages:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

Then run any script, for example:

```bash
python normed-spaces/lp_norm_example.py
```
